I provide much more value to my current position than I would ever receive back.
Working as a nurse assistant is a rewarding job, but not one that pays well enough
to support the lifestyle I would like to live. I want to be able to provide for my
family by doing something I enjoy, I feel as though learning the skills of web development
will allow me to accomplish that goal. If it turns out that this is not the correct path
for me, at least it will open new doors that I have not had before.
