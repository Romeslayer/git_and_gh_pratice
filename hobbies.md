# Hobbies
### Inline Skating
- I have been inline skating since I was 8 years old, I had gotten my first pair
for Christmas.
### Snowboarding
- This season will be my second season snowboarding, my wife and I started together
and my favorite resort is Winter Park.
### Hiking
- I really enjoy hiking, but I was tricked into doing the first time, I was told
that we would be going to the reservoir, but was not told that it would be a 30
minute hike. I was not ready since I had just moved here from sea level.
