# Favorite Vacation

### Road Trip to California
- So far my favorite vacation was a week long road trip to Trinidad, California
We left Colorado, spent one day in Nevada then the rest of our trip exploring
California before heading back. One of my favorite sights was the Great Coastal
Redwoods that towered and felt like an enchanting forest.
